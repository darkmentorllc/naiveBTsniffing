.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBrfcomm\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] <\fICOMMAND\fP> <\fIdev\fP>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBrfcomm(1)\fP is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the RFCOMM configuration
of the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. If no \fBcommand\fP is given,
or if the option \fB\-a\fP is used, \fBrfcomm\fP prints information about the
configured RFCOMM devices.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h
Gives a list of possible commands.
.TP
.B \-a
Prints information about all configured RFCOMM devices.
.TP
.B \-r
Switch TTY into raw mode (doesn\(aqt work with "bind").
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i <\fIhciX\fP> | <\fIbdaddr\fP>
The command is applied to device \fIhciX\fP, which must be the name or the
address of an installed Bluetooth device. If not specified, the command
will be use the first available Bluetooth device.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-A
Enable authentication
.TP
.B \-E
Enable encryption
.TP
.B \-S
Secure connection
.TP
.B \-C
Become the central of a piconet
.TP
.BI \-L \ <seconds>
Set linger timeout

.SH COMMANDS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B show <\fIdev\fP>
Display the information about the specified device.
.TP
.B connect <\fIdev\fP> [\fIbdaddr\fP] [\fIchannel\fP]
Connect the RFCOMM device to the remote Bluetooth device on the specified
channel. If no  channel  is  specified, it will use the channel
number \fB1\fP\&. This command can be terminated with the key sequence CTRL\-C.
.TP
.B listen <\fIdev\fP> [\fIchannel\fP] [\fIcmd\fP]
Listen  on  a specified RFCOMM channel for incoming connections.  If no
channel is specified, it will use the channel number \fB1\fP, but a channel
must be specified before cmd. If cmd is given, it will be executed as soon
as a  client  connects.  When the child process terminates or the client
disconnect, the command will terminate. Occurrences of {} in cmd will be
replaced by the name of the device used by the connection. This command
can be terminated with the key sequence CTRL\-C.
.TP
.B watch <\fIdev\fP> [\fIchannel\fP] [\fIcmd\fP]
Watch is identical to listen except that when the child process
terminates or the client disconnect, the command will restart listening
with the same parameters.
.TP
.B bind <\fIdev\fP> [\fIbdaddr\fP] [\fIchannel\fP]
This binds the RFCOMM device to a remote Bluetooth device. The command
does not establish a connection to the remote  device, it only creates
the binding. The connection will be established right after an application
tries to open the RFCOMM device. If no channel number is specified, it
uses the channel number \fB1\fP\&.
.TP
.B release <\fIdev\fP>
This command releases a defined RFCOMM binding.
.sp
If \fBall\fP is specified for the RFCOMM device, then all bindings will be
removed.
